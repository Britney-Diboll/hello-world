    <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
    <p>
The article "A brief history of web design for designers" is a great short atricle describing the start of web design after the web became a thing. Starting from the basic times of a black screen and green text to some of the most beautiful and complicated web pages ever designed. The simple question of if a web designer should know back end coding and vise versa has been a debate for decades.

Over the years there has been plenty changes in how web design has had to adapt to new technology. With the era of smart phones becoming the norm worldwide, designing web pages to be the same on a desktop and mobile devices proved to be a bit tricky at first. At this time web designers had to know how the background code worked.

With Responsive web design and simplifying visuals on a web page, better content is being pushed out easier. With the way technology is going and where is came from, it is constantly growing and evolving and I believe that both web designed and developers should know both front and back end of building a productive web page. They go hand in hand and the team should work together to make the best product/web page/code possible.
